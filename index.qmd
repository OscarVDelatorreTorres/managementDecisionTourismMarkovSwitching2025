# Introduction

This site is for the research documentation published in a private GitHub repository for replication purposes and as supplementary material for the paper **A two-regime Markov-switching, new sentiment multinomial algorithm for leisure and entertainment tourism stocks**, published in the journal [Management decision in the **** special number](https://www.emerald.com/insight/publication/issn/0025-1747).

The present site gives a detail of how did the authors collected and processed the input data and gives to the reader the steps and `R` code used to estimate the Markov-switching GARCH [@Hamitlon1989; @Haas2004a; @Haas2004a; @Ardia2018; @Ardia2018; @Ardia2016] model to forecast the probability $\xi_{s=2,t+1}$ of being in the high volatility regime at $t+1$ in the Intellidex Dynamic Leisure and Enerteinment index (DZL). The core idea is to backtest a trading rule based on the forecasted volatility of the DZL index to invest in the Invesco Leisure and Entertainment exchange traded fund (ETF) (PEJ) or in 3-month U.S. Treasury bills, depending on the forecasted volatility regime. The following trading rule summarises the trading strategy:

$$
S_t=\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\text{To sell the PEJ position if } \xi_{s=2,t} > 0.5 \\
\text{To Buy a PEJ if } \xi_{s=2,t} \leq 0.5
\end{array} \right.
$${#eq-msModelTag}

The core idea is to estimate the probability $\xi_{s=2,t+1}$ from a sequential selection of the MS-GARCH models of the following at $t$::

1. A symmetric Student-T log-likelihood function (LLF) with a homogeneous time-fixed volatility.
2. A symmetric Student-T LLF with a homogeneous symmetric GARCH volatility.
3. An symmetric Student-T LLF with a homogeneous asymmetric EGARCH volatility.
4. An asymmetric Student-T LLF with a homogeneous time-fixed volatility.
5. An asymmetric Student-T LLF with a homogeneous symmetric GARCH volatility.
6. An asymmetric Student-T LLF with a homogeneous asymmetric EGARCH volatility.

From these models, the authors selected the one with the lowest Akaike [-@Royall1997] value and use it to estimate the probability $\xi_{s=2,t+1}$ of being in the high volatility regime at $t+1$ as follows:

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{l}
\xi_{s=1,t+n}\\
\xi_{s=2,t+n}
\end{array}
\right]=\mathbf{\Pi}^n\left[
\begin{array}{l}
\xi_{s=1,t}\\
\xi_{s=2,t}
\end{array}
\right]
$${#eq-smoothProbForecast}

Where $\pi$ is the transition matrix of the Markov-switching model, $\xi_{s=1,t}$ is the smoothed probability of being in the low volatility regime at $t$, and $\xi_{s=2,t}$ is the probability of being in the high volatility regime at $t$.

This supplementary material's site is structured with the following sections:
