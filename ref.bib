The mathematical notation behind markov switching models and Hamilton's filter is not going to be exposed here since it is not the point. This definitely isn't an introductory document on the markov switching filter. My advice to those who are just starting out is to first read through the papers and books at the references and then come back here to check the application of the algorithm and the general computational structure (input/output) of the package. Also, be aware that this package is a direct translation of an existing Matlab package. It is available at: Broadly speaking there are no big differences in both packages but, the Matlab one has a couple of extra functionalities that are not available in the R package (e.g. choice of method for standard error calculation, use of C++ version of Hamilton's filter). The Mean Equation This particular R package is quite flexible when it comes to the specification of markov switching models. The central point of this flexibility resides in the input argument S, which controls for where to include markov switching effect. For instance, if you have 2 explanatory variables (1t x , 2t x) and if the input argument S, which is passed to the fitting function MS\_Regress\_Fit.R, is defined as S{\textless}-c(1,1), then the model for the mean equation is: 1 1 2 2 t t t S S S t t t t y x x β β σ ε = + + t S -represent the state at time t, that is, 1.... t S K = , where K is the number of states t S σ -model's standard deviation at state t S t S i β -beta coefficient for explanatory variable i at state t S where i goes from 1 to n t ε -residue which follows a particular distribution (in this case Normal or Student), with zero mean and std=var=1},

	doi = {10.1002/9781118445112.stat01532},
	abstract = {In mathematical statistics, the Fisher information (sometimes simply called information [1]) is a way of measuring the amount of information that an observ-able random variable X carries about an unknown pa-rameter θ of a distribution that models X. Formally, it is the variance of the score, or the expected value of the observed information. In Bayesian statistics, the asymptotic distribution of the posterior mode depends on the Fisher information and not on the prior (according to the Bernstein–von Mises theorem, which was antic-ipated by Laplace for exponential families). [2] The role of the Fisher information in the asymptotic theory of maximum-likelihood estimation was emphasized by the statistician Ronald Fisher (following some initial results by Francis Ysidro Edgeworth). The Fisher information is also used in the calculation of the Jeffreys prior, which is used in Bayesian statistics. The Fisher-information matrix is used to calculate the covariance matrices associated with maximum-likelihood estimates. It can also be used in the formu-lation of test statistics, such as the Wald test. Statistical systems of a scientific nature (physical, biologi-cal, etc.) whose likelihood functions obey shift invariance have been shown to obey maximum Fisher information. [3] The level of the maximum depends upon the nature of the system constraints. 1 Definition The Fisher information is a way of measuring the amount of information that an observable random variable X car-ries about an unknown parameter θ upon which the prob-ability of X depends. The probability function for X, which is also the likelihood function for θ, is a function f(X; θ); it is the probability mass (or probability density) of the random variable X conditional on the value of θ. The partial derivative with respect to θ of the natural log-arithm of the likelihood function is called the score. Under certain regularity conditions, [4] it can be shown that the first moment of the score (that is, its expected value) is 0:},

	abstract = {The use of Markov-switching models to capture the volatility dynamics of financial time series has grown considerably during past years, in part because they give rise to a plausible interpretation of nonlinearities. Nevertheless, GARCH-type models remain ubiquitous in order to allow for nonlinearities associated with time-varying volatility. Existing methods of combining the two approaches are unsatisfactory, as they either suffer from severe estimation difficulties or else their dynamic properties are not well understood. In this article we present a new Markov-switching GARCH model that overcomes both of these problems. Dynamic properties are derived and their implications for the volatility process discussed. We argue that the disaggregation of the variance process offered by the new model is more plausible than in the existing variants. The approach is illustrated with several exchange rate return series. The results suggest that a promising volatility model is an independent switching GARCH process with a possibly skewed conditional mixture density.},

	abstract = {We introduce new Markov-switching (MS) dynamic conditional score (DCS) exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (EGARCH) models, to be used by practitioners for forecasting value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) in systematic risk analysis. We use daily log-return data from the Standard \& Poor's 500 (S\&P 500) index for the period 1950-2016. The analysis of the S\&P 500 is useful, for example, for investors of (i) well-diversified US equity portfolios; (ii) S\&P 500 futures and options traded at Chicago Mercantile Exchange Globex; (iii) exchange traded funds (ETFs) related to the S\&P 500. The new MS DCS-EGARCH models are alternatives to of the recent MS Beta-t-EGARCH model that uses the symmetric Student's t distribution for the error term. For the new models, we use more flexible asymmetric probability distributions for the error term: Skew-Gent (skewed generalized t), EGB2 (exponential generalized beta of the second kind) and NIG (normal-inverse Gaussian) distributions. For all MS DCS-EGARCH models, we identify high-and low-volatility periods for the S\&P 500. We find that the statistical performance of the new MS DCS-EGARCH models is superior to that of the MS Beta-t-EGARCH model. As a practical application, we perform systematic risk analysis by forecasting VaR and ES.

	volume = {68},
	abstract = {Regime shifts present significant challenges for investors because they cause performance to depart significantly from the ranges implied by long-term averages of means and covariances. But regime shifts also present opportunities for gain. The authors show how to apply Markov-switching models to forecast regimes in market turbulence, inflation, and economic growth. They found that a dynamic process outperformed static asset allocation in backtests, especially for investors who seek to avoid large losses. nvestors have long recognized that economic conditions frequently undergo regime shifts. The economy often oscillates between a steady, low-volatility state characterized by economic growth and a panic-driven, high-volatility state characterized by economic contraction. Evidence of such regimes has been documented in market tur-bulence, 1 inflation, 2 and GDP or GNP. 3 Regime shifts present significant challenges for risk management and portfolio construction. For example, Ang and Bekaert (2002) demonstrated that regimes in financial assets lead to high down-side correlations. Indeed, prior studies have shown that exposure to different countries' equity markets offers less diversification in down markets than in up markets. 4 The same is true for global industry returns (Ferreira and Gama 2004), individual stock returns (Ang and Chen 2002), hedge fund returns (Van Royen 2002), and international bond market returns (Cappiello, Engle, and Sheppard 2003). Recently, Chua, Kritzman, and Page (2009) con-ducted an extensive empirical study of conditional correlations and concluded diversification based on unconditional covariances is largely a myth. Given this widespread evidence of nonsta-tionarity, it may be preferable to manage risk and construct portfolios on the basis of regime-specific estimates of the relevant inputs. The goal of our research was to build regime-dependent invest-ment strategies and backtest their performance out of sample. Many researchers have used Markov-switching models to " fit " a dataset and uncover evidence of regimes in sample, but far fewer have attempted out-of-sample forecasting. Nevertheless, as suggested by Harvey and Dahlquist (2001), if economic conditions are per-sistent and strongly linked to asset performance, then a dynamic asset allocation process should add value over static weights. We built a simple regime-switching model for the following variables (described in detail in the " Defining Economic Regime Variables " section): • Market turbulence • Inflation • Economic growth For each of these variables, we measured the per-formance of a variety of assets and risk premiums under each regime. Next, we turned to out-of-sample forecasting and backtesting. First, we tested the performance of the regime-switching approach for tactical asset allocation. We used regime forecasts to scale expo-sure to specific risk premiums over time and found that a dynamic process outperformed constant exposures. We then applied the same methodology to dynamic asset allocation across stocks, bonds, and cash. Again, we found that a dynamic process outperformed static asset allocation, especially for investors who seek to avoid large losses.},

In this paper, several properties of the model are derived. First, we provide a simple recursion for multi-step covariance forecasts under both Gaussian and Student’s t innovations, which is much simpler to implement than the formula presented by Pelletier (2006) for normally distributed errors. Second, we derive expressions for the unconditional covariances and correlations and the cross correlation function of the absolute returns. An application to returns of international stock and real estate markets shows that correlations between these asset classes increased substantially during the recent financial turmoil; moreover, in the regime–switching framework, employing a Student’s t distribution improves the forecasting performance vis-a`-vis the Gaussian.},

	abstract = {Summary Episodic memories are information-rich, often multisensory events that rely on binding different elements [1]. The elements that will constitute a memory episode are processed in specialized but distinct brain modules. The binding of these elements is most likely mediated by fast-acting long-term potentiation (LTP), which relies on the precise timing of neural activity [2]. Theta oscillations in the hippocampus orchestrate such timing as demonstrated by animal studies in vitro [3, 4] and in vivo [5, 6], suggesting a causal role of theta activity for the formation of complex memory episodes, but direct evidence from humans is missing. Here, we show that human episodic memory formation depends on phase synchrony between different sensory cortices at the theta frequency. By modulating the luminance of visual stimuli and the amplitude of auditory stimuli, we directly manipulated the degree of phase synchrony between visual and auditory cortices. Memory for sound-movie associations was significantly better when the stimuli were presented in phase compared to out of phase. This effect was specific to theta (4 Hz) and did not occur in slower (1.7 Hz) or faster (10.5 Hz) frequencies. These findings provide the first direct evidence that episodic memory formation in humans relies on a theta-specific synchronization mechanism.},

In this article we show that the local stationarity of the observed process is neither sufficient nor necessary to obtain the global stationarity. We derive stationarity conditions and we compute the autocovariance function of this nonlinear process. Interestingly, it turns out that the autocovariance structure coincides with that of a standard ARMA. Some examples are proposed to illustrate the stationarity conditions. Using Monte Carlo simulations we investigate the consequences of accounting for the stationarity conditions in statistical inference. © 2001 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

A consistent ‘abnormal’ return in excess of the benchmark is demonstrated over different time horizons and in different real world and simulated stock markets. A measure of stock price dispersion is shown to be a leading indicator for the abnormal return and their relationship is modelled as a Markov switching process of two market regimes. We find that the entire abnormal return is associated with the high volatility regime as the indexing model implicitly adopts a strategic position that pays off during market crashes, whilst effectively tracking the benchmark in normal market circumstances. Therefore we find no evidence of market inefficiency. Nevertheless our results have implications for equity fund managers: we show how, without any stock selection, solely through a smart optimization that has an implicit element of market timing, the benchmark performance can be significantly enhanced},

	abstract = {We analyze use of a quasi-likelihood ratio statistic for a mixture model to test the null hypothesis of one regime versus the alternative of two regimes in aMarkov regime- switching context. This test exploits mixture properties implied by the regime-switching process, but ignores certain implied serial correlation properties. When formulated in the natural way, the setting is nonstandard, involving nuisance parameters on the boundary of the parameter space, nuisance parameters identified only under the al- ternative, or approximations using derivatives higher than second order. We exploit recent advances by Andrews (2001) and contribute to the literature by extending the scope of mixture models, obtaining asymptotic null distributions different from those in the literature. We further provide critical values for popular models or bounds for tail probabilities that are useful in constructing conservative critical values for regime- switching tests.We compare the size and power of our statistics to other useful tests for regime switching via Monte Carlo methods and find relatively good performance. We apply our methods to reexamine the classic cartel study of Porter (1983) and reaffirm Porter’s findings},

Daily returns for a set of stock market indexes are predicted over about 13 years from the early 2000s.We find that Bayesian predictive densities improve the VaR backtest at the 1\% risk level for single models and for linear and log pools.

We argue that this is due to the high per- sistence of shocks in GARCH forecasts. To obtain more flexibility regarding volatility persistence, this paper generalizes the GARCH model by distin- guishing two regimes with different volatility levels; GARCH effects are al- lowed within each regime. The resulting Markov regime-switching GARCH model improves on existing variants, for instance by making multi-period- ahead volatility forecasting a convenient recursive procedure. The empirical analysis demonstrates that the model resolves the problem with the high single-regime GARCH forecasts and that it yields significantly better out- of-sample volatility forecasts.},

	volume = {52},
	doi = {10.1007/s00181-016-1069-5},
	abstract = {Forecasting oil prices is not straightforward, such that it is convenient to build a confidence interval around the forecasted prices. To this end, the principal ingredient for obtaining a reliable crude oil confidence interval is its volatility. Moreover , accurate crude oil volatility estimation has fundamental implications in terms of risk management, asset pricing and portfolio handling. Generally, current studies consider volatility models based on lagged crude oil price realizations and, at most, one additional macroeconomic variable as crude oil determinant. This paper aims to fill this gap, jointly considering not only traditional crude oil driving forces, such as the aggregate demand and oil supply, but also the monetary policy rate. Thus, this work aims to contribute to the debate concerning the potential impact of (lagged) US monetary policy as well as the other crude oil future price (COFP) determinants on daily COFP volatility. By means of the recently proposed generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity mixed data sampling model, different proxies of the US monetary policy alongside US industrial production (proxy of the US aggregate demand) and oil supply are included in the COFP volatility equation. Strong evidence that an expansionary (restrictive) variation in monetary policy anticipates a positive (negative) variation in COFP volatility is found. We also find that a negative (pos-itive) variation of industrial production increases (decreases) COFP volatility. This means that volatility behaves counter-cyclically, according to the literature.

It is designed to be used where there are a large number of time series to be forecast. However, a bootstrap version of the EIC can be used where there is a single time series to be forecast. The EIC provides a data-driven model selection tool that can be tuned to the particular forecasting task. We compare the EIC with other model selection criteria including Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and Schwarz's Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The comparisons show that for the M3 forecasting competition data, the EIC outperforms both the AIC and BIC, particularly for longer forecast horizons. We also compare the criteria on simulated data and find that the EIC does better than existing criteria in that case also.},
