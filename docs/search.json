    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis site is for the research documentation published in a private GitHub repository for replication purposes and as supplementary material for the paper A two-regime Markov-switching, new sentiment multinomial algorithm for leisure and entertainment tourism stocks, published in the journal Management decision in the **** special number.\nThe present site gives a detail of how did the authors collected and processed the input data and gives to the reader the steps and R code used to estimate the Markov-switching model to forecast the probability \\(\\xi_{s=2,t+1}\\) of being in the high volatility regime at \\(t+1\\). Also details the steps for the following trading rule with these forecasted volatilities:\n\\[\nS_t=\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{Sell if } \\xi_{s=2,t} &gt; 0.5 \\\\\n\\text{Buy or hold if } \\xi_{s=2,t} \\leq 0.5\n\\end{array} \\right.\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\nThe core idea is to estimate the probability \\(\\xi_{s=2,t+1}\\) from a sequential selection of the MS-GARCH models of the following at \\(t\\)::\n\nA symmetric Student-T log-likelihood function (LLF) with a homogeneous time-fixed volatility.\nA symmetric Student-T log-likelihood function (LLF) with a homogeneous symmetric GARCH volatility.\nAn symmetric Student-T log-likelihood function (LLF) with a homogeneous asymmetric EGARCH volatility.\nAn asymmetric Student-T log-likelihood function (LLF) with a homogeneous time-fixed volatility.\nAn asymmetric Student-T log-likelihood function (LLF) with a homogeneous symmetric GARCH volatility.\nAn asymmetric Student-T log-likelihood function (LLF) with a homogeneous asymmetric EGARCH volatility.\n\nFrom these models, the authors selected the one with the lowest Akaike (1974) value and use it to estimate the probability \\(\\xi_{s=2,t+1}\\) of being in the high volatility regime at \\(t+1\\) as follows:\n\\[\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\xi_{s=1,t+n}\\\\\n\\xi_{s=2,t+n}\n\\end{array}\n\\right]=\\mathbf{\\Pi}^n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\xi_{s=1,t}\\\\\n\\xi_{s=2,t}\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\tag{1.2}\\]\nWhere \\(\\pi\\) is the transition matrix of the Markov-switching model, \\(\\xi_{s=1,t}\\) is the smoothed probability of being in the low volatility regime at \\(t\\), and \\(\\xi_{s=2,t}\\) is the probability of being in the high volatility regime at \\(t\\).\n\n\n\n\nAkaike, Hirotugu. 1974. “A New Look at the Statistical Model Identification.” IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 19 (6): 716–23. https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CUB.2017.09.001.",
