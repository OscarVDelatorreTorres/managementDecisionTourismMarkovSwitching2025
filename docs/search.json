The core idea is to backtest a trading rule based on the forecasted volatility of the DZL index to invest in the Invesco Leisure and Entertainment exchange traded fund (ETF) (PEJ) or in 3-month U.S. Treasury bills, depending on the forecasted volatility regime. The following trading rule summarises the trading strategy:\n\\[\nS_t=\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{To buy 3-month U.S. Treasury bills if } \\xi_{s=2,t} &gt; 0.5 \\\\\n\\text{To Buy the PEJ if } \\xi_{s=2,t} \\leq 0.5\n\\end{array} \\right.\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\nThe core idea is to estimate the probability \\(\\xi_{s=2,t+1}\\) from a sequential selection of the MS-GARCH models of the following at \\(t\\)::\n\nA symmetric Student-T log-likelihood function (LLF) with a homogeneous time-fixed volatility.\nA symmetric Student-T LLF with a homogeneous symmetric GARCH volatility.\nAn symmetric Student-T LLF with a homogeneous asymmetric EGARCH volatility.\nAn asymmetric Student-T LLF with a homogeneous time-fixed volatility.\nAn asymmetric Student-T LLF with a homogeneous symmetric GARCH volatility.\nAn asymmetric Student-T LLF with a homogeneous asymmetric EGARCH volatility.\n\nFrom these models, the authors selected the one with the lowest Akaike (1974) value and use it to estimate the probability \\(\\xi_{s=2,t+1}\\) of being in the high volatility regime at \\(t+1\\) as follows:\n\\[\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\xi_{s=1,t+n}\\\\\n\\xi_{s=2,t+n}\n\\end{array}\n\\right]=\\mathbf{\\Pi}^n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\xi_{s=1,t}\\\\\n\\xi_{s=2,t}\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\tag{1.2}\\]\nWhere \\(\\pi\\) is the transition matrix of the Markov-switching model, \\(\\xi_{s=1,t}\\) is the smoothed probability of being in the low volatility regime at \\(t\\), and \\(\\xi_{s=2,t}\\) is the probability of being in the high volatility regime at \\(t\\).\nThis supplementary material’s site is structured with the following sections:\n\nData gathering and processing: Details the data gathering and processing steps.\nMarkov-switching model estimation, trading backtest and results: Details the steps to estimate the Markov-switching model and the trading rule and executes the code to estimate the model and the trading rule.\nReferences: Lists the references used in this site.\n\n\n\n\n\nAkaike, Hirotugu. 1974. “A New Look at the Statistical Model Identification.” IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 19 (6): 716–23. https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CUB.2017.09.001.\n\n\nArdia, David, Keven Bluteau, Kris Boudt, and Leopoldo Catania. 2018. “Forecasting Risk with Markov-Switching GARCH Models:A Large-Scale Performance Study.” International Journal of Forecasting 34 (4): 733–47. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2018.05.004.\n\n\nArdia, David, Keven Bluteau, Kris Boudt, Leopoldo Catania, and Denis–Alexandre Trottier. 2019. “Markov–Switching GARCH Models in R: The MSGARCH Package.” Journal of Statistical Software 91 (4): 1–39. https://doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.18637/jss.v091.i04.\n\n\nHaas, Markus, Stefan Mittnik, and Marc S Paolella. 2004. “A New Approach to Markov-Switching GARCH Models.” Journal of Financial Econometrics 2 (4): 493–530.\n\n\nHamilton, James D. 1989. “A New Approach to the Economic Analysis of Nonstationary Time Series and the Business Cycle.” Econometrica 57 (2): 357–84. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.2307/1912559.",
